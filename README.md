# üìä 3tx PowerBI Example

An example Power BI `.pbix` file that connects to the 3tx platform and fetches data for you to perform analysis upon. It is expected that a technical person who is more familiar with Power BI prepares a dashboard for the intended audience since some setup is required.

üöÄ Please be aware that this is currently an example, and is designed to showcase using the 3tx integration for Power BI. You will need knowledge of Power BI to make full use of this.

## üëè Getting Started

1. You will need to contact us for your data key. One will be generated and sent to you.
2. You will need to enter the `Manage Parameters` section inside the example `.pbix` and type in your `data key` and `organisation id`.
3. Refresh all your data sources. It is likely that they will refresh on their own.

The example file contains some simple metrics to get started, but they are by no means useful and it is suggested you delete them and use the data for your own needs.

# Advanced Tools

We provide two scripts, one for Windows and one for Mac/Linux

- `download-data.ps1` - Windows powershell
- `download-data.sh` - Mac/Linux

For Mac and Linux you will also need `jq` installed.

These scripts pull down all your `workforce`, `bookings`, `attestations`, `requirements`, `activities` parquet files so you can run data analysis on them locally.

Please see the files themselves for the parameters.
